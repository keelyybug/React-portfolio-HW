            <p className="p-3">
             I am a 23 year old recent Florida State University and University of Central Florida graduate! 
             <br />
             When I am not coding I bartend part time at a local lake front restaurant. I love getting to talk with all the locals and spend time with my two sisters who also work there. I also teach dance at a local studio, I have a very strong creative side that helps me a lot with designing and implimenting the perfect website for my clients.
             <br />
             I have three furbabies, a Russian Blue short hair named Jasper, a mini Australian Sheppard named Sadie Mae, and a toy Austrailian Sheppard named Samson! They certainly keep things interesting around the house! 
             <br />
             My goal is to travel, so a remote or hybrid position is very important to me! I am very excited to start my career in web development and I can't wait to see where it takes me!
